# Chalky

This is a syntax theme for Atom. I like it. It looks like this:

![ruby](https://github.com/duien/chalky-syntax/raw/master/screenshots/ruby.png)

I'll mostly test and use it with:
- Ruby
- JavaScript
- HAML
- Less/SCSS
- Elixir
- Markdown

It's a quick-and-dirty color swap of [:sparkles: brilliant :sparkles:](https://github.com/duien/brilliant-syntax) and lots of things still need tweaking. I definitely still need to figure out better styling for string interpolation. Font in the screenshots is [FF Attribute Mono](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-attribute-mono/).
