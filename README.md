# Chalky

This is a syntax theme for Atom. I like it. It looks like this:

![ruby](https://github.com/duien/chalky-syntax/raw/master/screenshots/ruby.png)
![css](https://github.com/duien/chalky-syntax/raw/master/screenshots/css.png)

I'll mostly test and use it with:
- Ruby
- JavaScript
- HAML
- Less/SCSS
- Elixir
- Markdown

It's a quick-and-dirty color swap of duien/brilliant-syntax and lots of things still need tweaking. I definitely still need to figure out better styling for string interpolation.
